# 💻 Infonet Alex | إنفونت ألكس

**A Full-Stack Digital Transformation & Media Buying Strategy for a Tech Retail Leader.**

## 💡 Project Idea

**Infonet Alex** is a commercial digital transformation project aimed at modernizing one of Alexandria's oldest tech retailers (Est. 1996).
The project addresses the brand's core challenge: bridging the gap between a strong offline legacy and a disconnected younger generation (Gen Z & Students).

We developed a **comprehensive marketing ecosystem** that includes:
* **Rebranding Strategy:** Refreshing the visual identity to reflect trust and modernity.
* **Performance Marketing:** A full media buying plan on Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok aimed at maximizing ROI.
* **Value-Based Content:** Shifting from "Sales-only" posts to educational content helping students choose the right laptop.
* **Sales Funnel Optimization:** Promoting "Installment Plans" as a key solution for high-ticket electronics.

This project proves how a traditional business can dominate the digital market through data-driven strategies and creative storytelling.
